    "thinking": "Okay, so I have this problem here: What is the least positive integer \\( n \\) such that \\( 80325 \\) divides \\( n! \\). Hmm, okay. I need to find the smallest \\( n \\) where \\( n! \\) is divisible by \\( 80325 \\). Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should factorize \\( 80325 \\) into its prime factors because that will help me determine what primes and their exponents are needed in \\( n! \\). So, let me try to factorize \\( 80325 \\).\n\nStarting off, I notice that \\( 80325 \\) ends with a 5, so it's divisible by 5. Let me divide it by 5:\n\n\\( 80325 \u00f7 5 = 16065 \\).\n\nOkay, that gives me 16065. That also ends with a 5, so let's divide by 5 again:\n\n\\( 16065 \u00f7 5 = 3213 \\).\n\nNow, 3213 doesn't end with a 5 or 0, so it's not divisible by 5. Let me check divisibility by 3. Adding the digits: 3 + 2 + 1 + 3 = 9, which is divisible by 3, so yes.\n\nDividing 3213 by 3:\n\n\\( 3213 \u00f7 3 = 1071 \\).\n\n1071 also adds up to 9, so it's divisible by 3 again:\n\n\\( 1071 \u00f7 3 = 357 \\).\n\n357 adds up to 15, which is divisible by 3:\n\n\\( 357 \u00f7 3 = 119 \\).\n\nNow, 119. Let me check divisibility by 7: 7 times 17 is 119, right? So,\n\n\\( 119 \u00f7 7 = 17 \\).\n\n17 is a prime number.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the prime factors of \\( 80325 \\) are:\n\n\\( 5^2 \\times 3^3 \\times 7 \\times 17 \\).\n\nAlright, so \\( 80325 = 5^2 \\times 3^3 \\times 7 \\times 17 \\).\n\nNow, I need to find the smallest \\( n \\) such that \\( n! \\) is divisible by this. That means \\( n! \\) must have at least the same prime factors with exponents equal to or greater than those in \\( 80325 \\).\n\nSo, I need to ensure that \\( n! \\) has:\n\n- At least two 5s,\n- At least three 3s,\n- At least one 7,\n- At least one 17.\n\nTherefore, the critical prime here is 17 because it's the largest prime factor. So, \\( n \\) must be at least 17 because 17 is a prime number, and it only appears in \\( n! \\) when \\( n \\) is 17 or larger. So, if \\( n \\) is less than 17, \\( n! \\) won't have 17 as a factor, which means \\( 80325 \\) won't divide \\( n! \\).\n\nBut let me verify if 17 is sufficient or if I need a larger \\( n \\). Because even though 17 is included in \\( 17! \\), I also need to make sure that the other prime factors have sufficient exponents in \\( 17! \\).\n\nSo, let me check the exponents of each prime in \\( 17! \\):\n\nStarting with prime 3: The exponent of 3 in \\( 17! \\) is calculated by:\n\n\\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{17}{3} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{17}{9} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{17}{27} \\right\\rfloor + \\dots \\)\n\nCalculating each term:\n\n\\( \\frac{17}{3} = 5.666... \\), so floor is 5.\n\n\\( \\frac{17}{9} = 1.888... \\), floor is 1.\n\n\\( \\frac{17}{27} = 0.629... \\), floor is 0.\n\nSo, total exponent of 3 is \\( 5 + 1 = 6 \\).\n\nBut in \\( 80325 \\), we only need 3^3. So, 6 is more than enough. Good.\n\nNext, prime 5: The exponent of 5 in \\( 17! \\) is:\n\n\\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{17}{5} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{17}{25} \\right\\rfloor + \\dots \\)\n\nCalculating:\n\n\\( \\frac{17}{5} = 3.4 \\), floor is 3.\n\n\\( \\frac{17}{25} = 0.68 \\), floor is 0.\n\nSo, total exponent of 5 is 3.\n\nBut \\( 80325 \\) only requires 5^2, so 3 is more than enough. Good.\n\nNext, prime 7: The exponent of 7 in \\( 17! \\) is:\n\n\\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{17}{7} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{17}{49} \\right\\rfloor + \\dots \\)\n\nCalculating:\n\n\\( \\frac{17}{7} = 2.428... \\), floor is 2.\n\n\\( \\frac{17}{49} = 0.346... \\), floor is 0.\n\nSo, total exponent of 7 is 2.\n\nBut \\( 80325 \\) only requires 7^1, so 2 is more than enough. Good.\n\nLastly, prime 17: The exponent of 17 in \\( 17! \\) is:\n\n\\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{17}{17} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{17}{289} \\right\\rfloor + \\dots \\)\n\nCalculating:\n\n\\( \\frac{17}{17} = 1 \\), floor is 1.\n\n\\( \\frac{17}{289} \\) is less than 1, so floor is 0.\n\nSo, total exponent of 17 is 1, which is exactly what we need.\n\nTherefore, \\( 17! \\) has all the necessary prime factors with exponents equal to or greater than those in \\( 80325 \\). So, does that mean 17 is the minimal \\( n \\)?\n\nWait, hold on. Let me double-check. Because sometimes, even though a prime is included, the exponents of other primes might not be sufficient if \\( n \\) is too low.\n\nBut in this case, we've already checked that in \\( 17! \\), the exponents for 3, 5, 7, and 17 are all sufficient. So, 17 seems to be the minimal \\( n \\).\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me check \\( 16! \\) to see if it's divisible by \\( 80325 \\).\n\nSo, \\( 16! \\) will not include 17 as a factor, so 17 is missing. Therefore, \\( 16! \\) is not divisible by 17, hence not divisible by \\( 80325 \\).\n\nTherefore, 17 is indeed the minimal \\( n \\).\n\nWait, but just to be extra careful, let me verify the exponents in \\( 17! \\) again.\n\nFor 3: 5 + 1 = 6, which is more than 3^3.\n\nFor 5: 3, which is more than 5^2.\n\nFor 7: 2, which is more than 7^1.\n\nFor 17: 1, which is exactly 17^1.\n\nSo, all exponents are satisfied. Therefore, 17 is the minimal \\( n \\).\n\nTherefore, the least positive integer \\( n \\) such that \\( 80325 \\) divides \\( n! \\) is 17.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe least positive integer \\( n \\) is \\boxed{17}.",
