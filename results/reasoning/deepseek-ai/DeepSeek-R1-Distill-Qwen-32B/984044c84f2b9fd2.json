    "question": "A sign painter paints individual numerals for a row of 50 houses. The houses are numbered with consecutive integers from 1 to 50. How many 9s are painted?Please reason step by step, and put your final answer within \boxed{}.",
    "thinking": "Okay, so I have this problem where a sign painter needs to paint individual numerals for 50 houses. The houses are numbered from 1 to 50, and I need to figure out how many times the digit 9 is painted. Hmm, okay, let me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, I guess I need to consider each house number from 1 to 50 and count how many times the digit 9 appears in each of these numbers. So, maybe I should break it down by the units place and the tens place separately. That sounds like a good plan because each digit in a number can be considered independently when counting occurrences.\n\nStarting with the units place: For numbers from 1 to 50, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9 every ten numbers. So, in the first ten numbers (1-10), the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0. Here, 9 appears once in the units place at number 9.\n\nSimilarly, in the next ten numbers (11-20), the units digits are again 1 through 0, so 9 appears once at 19. The same pattern continues for 21-30, 31-40, and 41-50. Each set of ten numbers will have one 9 in the units place. Since we're going up to 50, that's five sets of ten numbers. So, that would be 5 times 1, which is 5 nines in the units place.\n\nWait, hold on. Let me verify that. From 1-10: 9 once. 11-20: 19 once. 21-30: 29 once. 31-40: 39 once. 41-50: 49 once. Yep, that's five 9s in the units place. So, that's 5.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit is a bit different because it stays the same for ten consecutive numbers. For example, in 10-19, the tens digit is 1. In 20-29, it's 2, and so on. So, we need to check in which of these sets the tens digit is 9.\n\nLooking at the numbers from 1 to 50, the tens digit goes from 0 (for numbers 1-9) up to 4 (for 40-49). Then, 50 is a special case because it's 5 in the tens place. But since we're only going up to 50, the tens digits go up to 5. However, 9 doesn't appear in the tens place at all because the highest tens digit is 4 (for 40-49) and then 5 for 50. So, 9 never appears in the tens place in the numbers 1-50.\n\nWait, is that correct? Let me think again. For numbers 1-9, the tens digit is 0. For 10-19, it's 1. 20-29: 2. 30-39: 3. 40-49: 4. 50: 5. So, yes, the tens digit never reaches 9 in this range. So, that means there are zero 9s in the tens place.\n\nTherefore, combining both the units and tens places, the total number of 9s painted is 5 (from the units place) + 0 (from the tens place) = 5.\n\nBut hold on, let me double-check by actually listing out all the numbers from 1 to 50 and counting the 9s. Maybe I missed something.\n\nNumbers with 9 in the units place: 9, 19, 29, 39, 49. That's five numbers, each contributing one 9. So, that's five 9s.\n\nNumbers with 9 in the tens place: Well, if there were any, they would be 90-99, but we only go up to 50, so there are none. So, zero 9s there.\n\nTherefore, total 9s painted are 5. That seems correct.\n\nWait, another thought: Is 0 considered in the units place? For example, number 10 has a 0 in the units place, but that doesn't affect the count of 9s. So, no issue there.\n\nAlso, what about the number 50? It's 5 and 0, so no 9 there either. So, yeah, 50 doesn't add any 9s.\n\nJust to make sure, let's go through each number from 1 to 50 and count the 9s:\n\n1: no 9\n2: no 9\n3: no 9\n4: no 9\n5: no 9\n6: no 9\n7: no 9\n8: no 9\n9: one 9\n10: no 9\n11: no 9\n12: no 9\n13: no 9\n14: no 9\n15: no 9\n16: no 9\n17: no 9\n18: no 9\n19: one 9\n20: no 9\n21: no 9\n22: no 9\n23: no 9\n24: no 9\n25: no 9\n26: no 9\n27: no 9\n28: no 9\n29: one 9\n30: no 9\n31: no 9\n32: no 9\n33: no 9\n34: no 9\n35: no 9\n36: no 9\n37: no 9\n38: no 9\n39: one 9\n40: no 9\n41: no 9\n42: no 9\n43: no 9\n44: no 9\n45: no 9\n46: no 9\n47: no 9\n48: no 9\n49: one 9\n50: no 9\n\nCounting the 9s: 9,19,29,39,49. That's five 9s. So, yes, that's consistent.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 5.\n\nWait, but hold on a second. The question says \"individual numerals.\" So, does that mean that if a number has two digits, like 10, it's considered as two separate numerals? But in our case, we're only looking for the numeral 9. So, for each number, we check each digit. So, for example, number 9 is one numeral, number 19 is two numerals, 1 and 9, so only the 9 counts. Similarly, 29 is 2 and 9, so only the 9 counts. So, yeah, in each number, we're just looking for the occurrence of 9 as a digit, regardless of its position.\n\nTherefore, my initial reasoning holds. Each 9 in the units place is counted, and since there are no 9s in the tens place, the total is five.\n\nJust to make sure, let me think about a different approach. How many numbers between 1 and 50 have a 9 in them? Well, as I listed earlier, they are 9,19,29,39,49. So, five numbers. Each of these contributes exactly one 9. So, 5 nines in total.\n\nTherefore, regardless of how I approach it, the answer is 5.\n\nI think that's solid. So, I can confidently say that the number of 9s painted is 5.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe number of 9s painted is \\boxed{5}.",
    "response": "To determine how many times the digit 9 is painted on the house numbers from 1 to 50, we need to consider both the units place and the tens place separately.\n\n1. **Units Place Analysis**:\n   - The units digit cycles from 0 to 9 every ten numbers.\n   - In each set of ten numbers (1-10, 11-20, 21-30, 31-40, 41-50), the digit 9 appears once in the units place.\n   - Therefore, there are 5 occurrences of the digit 9 in the units place.\n\n2. **Tens Place Analysis**:\n   - The tens digit remains the same for ten consecutive numbers.\n   - For numbers from 1 to 50, the tens digits range from 0 to 5.\n   - The digit 9 never appears in the tens place within this range.\n\nCombining both analyses, we find that the digit 9 appears 5 times in the units place and 0 times in the tens place. Thus, the total number of 9s painted is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{5}\n\\]"
