    "thinking": "Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the area of triangle ABC. The vertices are given as A(-4, -1), B(2, -1), and C(1, 3). Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that there are a few ways to calculate the area of a triangle when you know the coordinates of its vertices. One common method is using the shoelace formula. Another way is to find the base and height of the triangle and then apply the formula (1/2)*base*height. I think I'll try both methods to make sure I get the same answer.\n\nLet me start with the shoelace formula because it seems straightforward with coordinates. The shoelace formula is given by:\n\nArea = |(x1(y2 - y3) + x2(y3 - y1) + x3(y1 - y2))/2|\n\nPlugging in the coordinates:\n\nx1 = -4, y1 = -1 (Point A)\nx2 = 2, y2 = -1 (Point B)\nx3 = 1, y3 = 3 (Point C)\n\nSo substituting these into the formula:\n\nArea = |(-4*(-1 - 3) + 2*(3 - (-1)) + 1*(-1 - (-1)))/2|\n\nLet me compute each part step by step.\n\nFirst term: -4*(-1 - 3) = -4*(-4) = 16\n\nSecond term: 2*(3 - (-1)) = 2*(4) = 8\n\nThird term: 1*(-1 - (-1)) = 1*(0) = 0\n\nAdding these together: 16 + 8 + 0 = 24\n\nNow, take the absolute value (which is still 24) and divide by 2: 24/2 = 12\n\nSo the area is 12 square units according to the shoelace formula. That seems pretty straightforward.\n\nBut just to double-check, let me try the other method: finding the base and height.\n\nLooking at the coordinates, points A and B have the same y-coordinate (-1). That means the line AB is horizontal. So, the length of AB can be found by subtracting the x-coordinates.\n\nLength AB = |x2 - x1| = |2 - (-4)| = |2 + 4| = 6 units.\n\nSo, the base of the triangle is 6 units.\n\nNow, I need to find the height, which is the perpendicular distance from point C to the base AB. Since AB is horizontal, the height will just be the vertical distance from point C to the line AB.\n\nPoint C has coordinates (1, 3). The line AB is at y = -1. So, the vertical distance is |3 - (-1)| = |3 + 1| = 4 units.\n\nTherefore, the height is 4 units.\n\nNow, applying the area formula: (1/2)*base*height = (1/2)*6*4 = (1/2)*24 = 12 square units.\n\nHmm, that's the same answer as before. So, both methods give me 12. That makes me confident that the area is indeed 12 square units.\n\nWait, just to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the shoelace formula, let me write it out again step by step.\n\nThe shoelace formula can also be remembered as multiplying in a crisscross pattern and then subtracting. So, writing the coordinates in order and repeating the first at the end:\n\nA(-4, -1)\nB(2, -1)\nC(1, 3)\nA(-4, -1)\n\nNow, multiply diagonally:\n\n(-4)*(-1) = 4\n\n2*3 = 6\n\n1*(-1) = -1\n\nSum these: 4 + 6 + (-1) = 9\n\nThen, multiply the other diagonal:\n\n(-1)*2 = -2\n\n(-1)*1 = -1\n\n3*(-4) = -12\n\nSum these: -2 + (-1) + (-12) = -15\n\nNow, subtract the second sum from the first: 9 - (-15) = 9 + 15 = 24\n\nTake the absolute value and divide by 2: |24| / 2 = 12\n\nYep, that still gives me 12. So, three different ways of thinking about it, all leading to the same answer. I think that's solid.\n\nJust to visualize, let me sketch the triangle in my mind. Points A and B are on the same horizontal line, 6 units apart. Point C is above them, 4 units higher. So, the triangle is a sort of \"upside-down\" shape with a base of 6 and height of 4. The area being 12 makes sense because it's a fairly large triangle.\n\nAnother way to think about it is using vectors or determinants, but I think the two methods I've used are sufficient for verification.\n\nAlternatively, I could use the formula for the area of a triangle given by coordinates:\n\nArea = 1/2 | (x1(y2 - y3) + x2(y3 - y1) + x3(y1 - y2)) |\n\nWhich is essentially the shoelace formula again. So, plugging in:\n\n1/2 | (-4*(-1 - 3) + 2*(3 - (-1)) + 1*(-1 - (-1)) ) |\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n1/2 | (-4*(-4) + 2*(4) + 1*(0) ) | = 1/2 | 16 + 8 + 0 | = 1/2 * 24 = 12\n\nYep, same result.\n\nI think I've verified this in every way I can think of. Both the shoelace formula and the base-height method give me 12, so I feel confident that the area is 12 square units.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe area of triangle \\(ABC\\) is \\boxed{12} square units.",
