    "thinking": "Okay, so I need to find the smallest positive integer \\( n \\) such that \\( 80325 \\) divides \\( n! \\). Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that if a number divides \\( n! \\), all the prime factors of that number must be present in \\( n! \\). So, maybe I should start by factoring \\( 80325 \\) into its prime components. That should help me understand what primes I need to look for in \\( n! \\).\n\nLet me try factoring \\( 80325 \\). I know that \\( 80325 \\) ends with a 5, so it's divisible by 5. Let me divide it by 5:\n\n\\( 80325 \u00f7 5 = 16065 \\).\n\nOkay, so 5 is one of the prime factors. Now, \\( 16065 \\) also ends with a 5, so let's divide by 5 again:\n\n\\( 16065 \u00f7 5 = 3213 \\).\n\nAlright, so another 5. Now, \\( 3213 \\). Let me check if this is divisible by 3. Adding the digits: 3 + 2 + 1 + 3 = 9, which is divisible by 3. So, dividing by 3:\n\n\\( 3213 \u00f7 3 = 1071 \\).\n\nGreat, so 3 is another prime factor. Now, \\( 1071 \\). Let's check divisibility by 3 again: 1 + 0 + 7 + 1 = 9, which is divisible by 3.\n\n\\( 1071 \u00f7 3 = 357 \\).\n\nAnother 3. Now, \\( 357 \\). Again, check for 3: 3 + 5 + 7 = 15, divisible by 3.\n\n\\( 357 \u00f7 3 = 119 \\).\n\nSo, another 3. Now, \\( 119 \\). Let me check divisibility by 7: 119 \u00f7 7 = 17. Perfect, so 7 is a prime factor, and then 17 is also a prime.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the prime factorization of \\( 80325 \\) is:\n\n\\( 80325 = 5^2 \u00d7 3^3 \u00d7 7 \u00d7 17 \\).\n\nOkay, so now I know that \\( n! \\) must have at least two 5s, three 3s, one 7, and one 17 in its prime factorization. My job is to find the smallest \\( n \\) such that all these are satisfied.\n\nI remember that the number of times a prime \\( p \\) divides \\( n! \\) is given by the sum \\( \\lfloor \\frac{n}{p} \\rfloor + \\lfloor \\frac{n}{p^2} \\rfloor + \\lfloor \\frac{n}{p^3} \\rfloor + \\ldots \\) until the terms become zero.\n\nSo, I need to make sure that for each prime in the factorization, the number of times it appears in \\( n! \\) is at least as much as required by \\( 80325 \\).\n\nLet me list the required exponents:\n\n- For 5: at least 2\n- For 3: at least 3\n- For 7: at least 1\n- For 17: at least 1\n\nSo, I need to find the smallest \\( n \\) such that:\n\n1. The number of 5s in \\( n! \\) is \u2265 2.\n2. The number of 3s in \\( n! \\) is \u2265 3.\n3. The number of 7s in \\( n! \\) is \u2265 1.\n4. The number of 17s in \\( n! \\) is \u2265 1.\n\nNow, let's analyze each condition.\n\nStarting with 17, since it's the largest prime here. For 17 to divide \\( n! \\), \\( n \\) must be at least 17. Because 17 is a prime, it won't appear in the factorial until \\( n \\) reaches 17.\n\nSo, \\( n \\) must be at least 17. But let me check the other conditions as well.\n\nFor 7: Similarly, 7 is a prime, so it will first appear in \\( 7! \\). So, as long as \\( n \\) is \u2265 7, which it already is since \\( n \\) has to be \u226517, we are good.\n\nFor 3: We need at least 3 factors of 3 in \\( n! \\). Let's compute how many 3s are in \\( 17! \\).\n\nNumber of 3s in \\( 17! \\):\n\n\\( \\lfloor \\frac{17}{3} \\rfloor + \\lfloor \\frac{17}{9} \\rfloor + \\lfloor \\frac{17}{27} \\rfloor + \\ldots \\)\n\nCalculating each term:\n\n- \\( \\lfloor \\frac{17}{3} \\rfloor = 5 \\)\n- \\( \\lfloor \\frac{17}{9} \\rfloor = 1 \\)\n- \\( \\lfloor \\frac{17}{27} \\rfloor = 0 \\)\n\nSo, total number of 3s is \\( 5 + 1 = 6 \\). Which is more than the required 3. So, that's fine.\n\nFor 5: We need at least 2 factors of 5 in \\( n! \\). Let's compute the number of 5s in \\( 17! \\):\n\n\\( \\lfloor \\frac{17}{5} \\rfloor + \\lfloor \\frac{17}{25} \\rfloor + \\ldots \\)\n\nCalculating each term:\n\n- \\( \\lfloor \\frac{17}{5} \\rfloor = 3 \\)\n- \\( \\lfloor \\frac{17}{25} \\rfloor = 0 \\)\n\nSo, total number of 5s is 3, which is more than the required 2. So, that's also fine.\n\nWait, so if \\( n = 17 \\), does \\( 80325 \\) divide \\( 17! \\)?\n\nLet me check: \\( 17! \\) includes 17, which is good. It includes 7, which is good. It includes three 5s and six 3s, which is more than required. So, it seems like \\( n = 17 \\) is sufficient.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure. Is \\( 80325 \\) actually a divisor of \\( 17! \\)?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should check if \\( 17! \\) is divisible by \\( 80325 \\). Since \\( 80325 \\) is \\( 5^2 \u00d7 3^3 \u00d7 7 \u00d7 17 \\), and \\( 17! \\) has \\( 5^3 \\), \\( 3^6 \\), \\( 7^2 \\), and \\( 17^1 \\). So, yes, \\( 17! \\) has more than enough of each prime factor.\n\nBut wait, is \\( n = 17 \\) the minimal such \\( n \\)?\n\nWait, could it be less? Let's see.\n\nIf \\( n = 16 \\), then \\( 16! \\) doesn't include 17, so 17 won't be a factor. Therefore, \\( 80325 \\) can't divide \\( 16! \\) because 17 is a prime factor of \\( 80325 \\) and isn't present in \\( 16! \\).\n\nSimilarly, \\( n = 17 \\) is the first factorial that includes 17, so it's the minimal \\( n \\) where \\( 80325 \\) divides \\( n! \\).\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me check the number of 3s and 5s in \\( 17! \\) to ensure that they meet the required exponents.\n\nNumber of 3s:\n\nAs I calculated before, it's 5 (from \\( 17/3 \\)) plus 1 (from \\( 17/9 \\)), so 6. Since we need only 3, that's fine.\n\nNumber of 5s:\n\n3 (from \\( 17/5 \\)), which is more than the required 2. So, that's also fine.\n\nNumber of 7s:\n\n\\( \\lfloor 17/7 \\rfloor = 2 \\), so two 7s. We need only one, so that's fine.\n\nNumber of 17s:\n\n1, which is exactly what we need.\n\nSo, all required exponents are satisfied in \\( 17! \\).\n\nBut just to make sure, let me check \\( 17! \\) divided by \\( 80325 \\). If it's an integer, then 17 is the minimal \\( n \\).\n\nBut computing \\( 17! \\) is a huge number, so maybe I can do it step by step.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute the prime exponents as above and see that \\( 17! \\) has all the necessary exponents.\n\nWait, another thought: is \\( 80325 \\) equal to \\( 5^2 \u00d7 3^3 \u00d7 7 \u00d7 17 \\)?\n\nYes, as we factored earlier. So, as long as \\( n! \\) includes all these primes with at least those exponents, it should be divisible by \\( 80325 \\).\n\nSo, since \\( n = 17 \\) is the first factorial that includes 17, and since all other primes (5, 3, 7) are included with sufficient exponents before 17, \\( n = 17 \\) is indeed the minimal such \\( n \\).\n\nTherefore, the least positive integer \\( n \\) such that \\( 80325 \\) divides \\( n! \\) is 17.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe least positive integer \\( n \\) is \\boxed{17}.",
