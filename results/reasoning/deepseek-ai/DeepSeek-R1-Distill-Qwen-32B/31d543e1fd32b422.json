    "question": "What is the period of $y = \\sin 5x $?Please reason step by step, and put your final answer within \boxed{}.",
    "thinking": "Okay, so I need to find the period of the function y = sin(5x). Hmm, I remember that the sine function has a standard period, but when there's a coefficient in front of x, it affects the period. Let me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, the basic sine function is y = sin(x). I know that the period of this function is 2\u03c0. That means it completes one full cycle every 2\u03c0 units along the x-axis. So, if I graph y = sin(x), it goes up to 1 at \u03c0/2, back to 0 at \u03c0, down to -1 at 3\u03c0/2, and back to 0 at 2\u03c0. Then it repeats this pattern indefinitely.\n\nNow, in the given function, instead of just x, we have 5x inside the sine function. So, it's y = sin(5x). I recall that when there's a coefficient inside the sine function, it affects the period. Specifically, if the function is y = sin(Bx), the period is 2\u03c0 divided by the absolute value of B. So, the formula is Period = 2\u03c0 / |B|.\n\nLet me verify that. Suppose B is 1, then the period is 2\u03c0, which matches the standard sine function. If B is 2, then the period is \u03c0, meaning the function completes a cycle twice as fast. Similarly, if B is 1/2, the period becomes 4\u03c0, meaning it takes twice as long to complete a cycle. So, this formula seems correct.\n\nApplying this to the given function, y = sin(5x). Here, B is 5. So, plugging into the formula, Period = 2\u03c0 / |5|. Since 5 is positive, the absolute value doesn't change anything. So, Period = 2\u03c0 / 5.\n\nWait, let me make sure I'm not confusing the amplitude or anything else with the period. The amplitude of a sine function is the coefficient in front of the sine, but in this case, it's just 1, so the amplitude is 1, which is standard. The period is only affected by the coefficient inside the sine function, which is 5 in this case.\n\nSo, if I think about the graph of y = sin(5x), it should complete a full cycle in 2\u03c0/5 units instead of 2\u03c0. That means it's compressed horizontally by a factor of 5. So, instead of taking 2\u03c0 to go up, down, and back, it does it much faster.\n\nLet me test this with specific points. For the standard sine function, at x = 0, sin(0) = 0. At x = \u03c0/2, sin(\u03c0/2) = 1. At x = \u03c0, sin(\u03c0) = 0. At x = 3\u03c0/2, sin(3\u03c0/2) = -1. At x = 2\u03c0, sin(2\u03c0) = 0. So, that's one full period.\n\nFor y = sin(5x), let's see when it completes one full period. Let me find the points where it starts and ends a cycle. The function will start at 0 when x = 0. Then, it will reach 1 at some point, come back to 0, reach -1, and then return to 0. The key is to find the x-values where the function completes a full cycle.\n\nTo find when the function completes a period, we can set 5x equal to 2\u03c0, since the standard sine function completes a period at 2\u03c0. So, 5x = 2\u03c0 implies x = 2\u03c0/5. So, at x = 2\u03c0/5, the function y = sin(5x) completes one full period.\n\nLet me check specific points. At x = 0, sin(5*0) = sin(0) = 0. At x = \u03c0/10, sin(5*(\u03c0/10)) = sin(\u03c0/2) = 1. At x = 2\u03c0/10 = \u03c0/5, sin(5*(\u03c0/5)) = sin(\u03c0) = 0. At x = 3\u03c0/10, sin(5*(3\u03c0/10)) = sin(3\u03c0/2) = -1. At x = 4\u03c0/10 = 2\u03c0/5, sin(5*(2\u03c0/5)) = sin(2\u03c0) = 0. So, that's one full period from x=0 to x=2\u03c0/5.\n\nTherefore, the period is indeed 2\u03c0/5. So, I think I've got it. The coefficient inside the sine function affects the period by dividing 2\u03c0 by that coefficient. So, for y = sin(Bx), the period is 2\u03c0/B.\n\nWait, just to make sure, let's consider another example. If I have y = sin(2x), then the period should be 2\u03c0/2 = \u03c0. Let's test this. At x=0, sin(0)=0. At x=\u03c0/4, sin(2*(\u03c0/4))=sin(\u03c0/2)=1. At x=\u03c0/2, sin(2*(\u03c0/2))=sin(\u03c0)=0. At x=3\u03c0/4, sin(2*(3\u03c0/4))=sin(3\u03c0/2)=-1. At x=\u03c0, sin(2\u03c0)=0. So, that's a full period from 0 to \u03c0, which is correct. So, the formula works here.\n\nSimilarly, if I have y = sin(x/2), then the period would be 2\u03c0/(1/2) = 4\u03c0. Let's check. At x=0, sin(0)=0. At x=2\u03c0, sin(2\u03c0/2)=sin(\u03c0)=0. Wait, that's not a full cycle. Let's see. At x= \u03c0, sin(\u03c0/2)=1. At x=2\u03c0, sin(2\u03c0/2)=sin(\u03c0)=0. At x=3\u03c0, sin(3\u03c0/2)=-1. At x=4\u03c0, sin(4\u03c0/2)=sin(2\u03c0)=0. So, yes, from x=0 to x=4\u03c0, it completes a full cycle. So, the formula works here as well.\n\nTherefore, applying the same logic, for y = sin(5x), the period is 2\u03c0/5.\n\nJust to think about it another way, the period of a function is the length after which the function repeats its values. So, for sin(5x), when does sin(5x) = sin(5(x + T))? We know that sine is periodic with period 2\u03c0, so sin(\u03b8) = sin(\u03b8 + 2\u03c0). So, if we set 5(x + T) = 5x + 2\u03c0, then 5x + 5T = 5x + 2\u03c0. Subtracting 5x from both sides, we get 5T = 2\u03c0. Therefore, T = 2\u03c0/5. So, that's another way to see it.\n\nSo, regardless of the method, whether using the formula, testing specific points, or solving for T in the equation, we arrive at the same result: the period is 2\u03c0/5.\n\nI think I'm confident now that the period of y = sin(5x) is 2\u03c0/5.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe period of \\( y = \\sin 5x \\) is \\boxed{\\dfrac{2\\pi}{5}}.",
