    "question": "An elephant and a lion are currently 1 mile apart. The elephant runs directly away from the lion at 19 miles per hour, while the lion runs directly towards the elephant at 24 miles per hour.  How many minutes will it take for the lion to catch the elephant?",
    "solution": "Every hour, the lion runs 24 miles while the elephant runs 19.  Thus, the distance between the two animals closes at a rate of 5 miles every hour.  The lion catches the elephant after this distance has closed 1 mile, which takes $\\frac{1}{5}$ hours to do, or $\\frac{1}{5}\\cdot 60 = \\boxed{12}$ minutes.",
    "attempt": "To determine how long it will take for the lion to catch the elephant, we need to calculate the relative speed at which the distance between them is decreasing. \n\n1. The elephant is running away from the lion at 19 miles per hour.\n2. The lion is running towards the elephant at 24 miles per hour.\n\nThe relative speed at which the distance between the lion and the elephant is decreasing is the sum of their speeds:\n\\[ \\text{Relative speed} = 24 \\text{ mph} + 19 \\text{ mph} = 43 \\text{ mph} \\]\n\nThe initial distance between the elephant and the lion is 1 mile. To find the time it takes for the lion to catch the elephant, we use the formula:\n\\[ \\text{Time} = \\frac{\\text{Distance}}{\\text{Relative speed}} \\]\n\nSubstituting the known values:\n\\[ \\text{Time} = \\frac{1 \\text{ mile}}{43 \\text{ mph}} \\]\n\nThis gives us the time in hours. To convert this time into minutes, we multiply by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):\n\\[ \\text{Time in minutes} = \\frac{1 \\text{ mile}}{43 \\text{ mph}} \\times 60 \\text{ minutes/hour} = \\frac{60}{43} \\text{ minutes} \\]\n\nCalculating the exact value:\n\\[ \\frac{60}{43} \\approx 1.3953 \\text{ minutes} \\]\n\nRounding to two decimal places, the time it takes for the lion to catch the elephant is approximately:\n\\[ \\boxed{1.40} \\text{ minutes} \\]"
