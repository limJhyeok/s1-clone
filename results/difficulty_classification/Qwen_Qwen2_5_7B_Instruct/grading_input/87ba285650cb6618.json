    "attempt": "To find the probability that the number of heads obtained from flipping coin \\(A\\) three times and coin \\(B\\) four times is the same, we need to consider the possible outcomes for the number of heads in each set of flips and their corresponding probabilities.\n\nFirst, let's determine the probability distribution for the number of heads in three flips of a fair coin. The number of heads can be 0, 1, 2, or 3. The probability of getting exactly \\(k\\) heads in three flips is given by the binomial probability formula:\n\\[\nP(X = k) = \\binom{3}{k} \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^3\n\\]\nCalculating each case:\n\\[\nP(X = 0) = \\binom{3}{0} \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^3 = \\frac{1}{8}\n\\]\n\\[\nP(X = 1) = \\binom{3}{1} \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^3 = \\frac{3}{8}\n\\]\n\\[\nP(X = 2) = \\binom{3}{2} \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^3 = \\frac{3}{8}\n\\]\n\\[\nP(X = 3) = \\binom{3}{3} \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^3 = \\frac{1}{8}\n\\]\n\nNext, let's determine the probability distribution for the number of heads in four flips of a fair coin. The number of heads can be 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4. The probability of getting exactly \\(k\\) heads in four flips is:\n\\[\nP(Y = k) = \\binom{4}{k} \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^4\n\\]\nCalculating each case:\n\\[\nP(Y = 0) = \\binom{4}{0} \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^4 = \\frac{1}{16}\n\\]\n\\[\nP(Y = 1) = \\binom{4}{1} \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^4 = \\frac{4}{16} = \\frac{1}{4}\n\\]\n\\[\nP(Y = 2) = \\binom{4}{2} \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^4 = \\frac{6}{16} = \\frac{3}{8}\n\\]\n\\[\nP(Y = 3) = \\binom{4}{3} \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^4 = \\frac{4}{16} = \\frac{1}{4}\n\\]\n\\[\nP(Y = 4) = \\binom{4}{4} \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^4 = \\frac{1}{16}\n\\]\n\nWe need to find the probability that the number of heads from coin \\(A\\) (which is \\(X\\)) is equal to the number of heads from coin \\(B\\) (which is \\(Y\\)). This is the sum of the probabilities of the events where \\(X = Y\\):\n\\[\nP(X = Y) = P(X = 0, Y = 0) + P(X = 1, Y = 1) + P(X = 2, Y = 2) + P(X = 3, Y = 3)\n\\]\nUsing the independence of the two coin flips, we have:\n\\[\nP(X = 0, Y = 0) = P(X = 0) \\cdot P(Y = 0) = \\frac{1}{8} \\cdot \\frac{1}{16} = \\frac{1}{128}\n\\]\n\\[\nP(X = 1, Y = 1) = P(X = 1) \\cdot P(Y = 1) = \\frac{3}{8} \\cdot \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{3}{32}\n\\]\n\\[\nP(X = 2, Y = 2) = P(X = 2) \\cdot P(Y = 2) = \\frac{3}{8} \\cdot \\frac{3}{8} = \\frac{9}{64}\n\\]\n\\[\nP(X = 3, Y = 3) = P(X = 3) \\cdot P(Y = 3) = \\frac{1}{8} \\cdot \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{1}{32}\n\\]\nAdding these probabilities together, we get:\n\\[\nP(X = Y) = \\frac{1}{128} + \\frac{3}{32} + \\frac{9}{64} + \\frac{1}{"
