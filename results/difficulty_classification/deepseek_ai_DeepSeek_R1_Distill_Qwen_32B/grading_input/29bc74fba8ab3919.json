    "question": "An elephant and a lion are currently 1 mile apart. The elephant runs directly away from the lion at 19 miles per hour, while the lion runs directly towards the elephant at 24 miles per hour.  How many minutes will it take for the lion to catch the elephant?",
    "solution": "Every hour, the lion runs 24 miles while the elephant runs 19. Thus, the distance between the two animals closes at a rate of 5 miles every hour. The lion catches the elephant after this distance has closed 1 mile, which takes $\frac{1}{5}$ hours to do, or $\frac{1}{5}\\cdot 60 = \boxed{12}$ minutes.",
    "attempt": "The elephant and the lion are initially 1 mile apart. The elephant is running directly away from the lion at 19 miles per hour, while the lion is running towards the elephant at 24 miles per hour. \n\nTo determine how long it will take for the lion to catch the elephant, we calculate the relative speed at which the distance between them is decreasing. This is the difference between the lion's speed and the elephant's speed:\n\n\\[\n24 \\text{ mph} - 19 \\text{ mph} = 5 \\text{ mph}\n\\]\n\nThe time it takes for the lion to catch the elephant is the initial distance divided by this relative speed:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Time} = \\frac{1 \\text{ mile}}{5 \\text{ mph}} = 0.2 \\text{ hours}\n\\]\n\nConverting this time into minutes:\n\n\\[\n0.2 \\text{ hours} \\times 60 \\text{ minutes per hour} = 12 \\text{ minutes}\n\\]\n\nThus, the lion will catch the elephant in \\boxed{12} minutes."
