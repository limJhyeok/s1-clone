    "question": "What is the least positive integer $n$ such that $80325$ divides $n!$?",
    "solution": "We find the prime factorization of $80325$, which is $3^3 \\cdot 5^2 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 17$. The largest prime in the factorization is $17$, so $n$ is at least 17. Since there are three factors of $3$, two factors of $5$, and one factor of $7$ in the prime factorization of $17!$, the minimum value of $n$ is $\boxed{17}$.",
    "attempt": "To find the least positive integer \\( n \\) such that \\( 80325 \\) divides \\( n! \\), we start by factoring \\( 80325 \\) into its prime components:\n\n\\[\n80325 = 5^2 \\times 3^3 \\times 7 \\times 17\n\\]\n\nWe need to ensure that \\( n! \\) contains at least the prime factors \\( 5^2 \\), \\( 3^3 \\), \\( 7 \\), and \\( 17 \\).\n\n1. The prime factor \\( 17 \\) must be present in \\( n! \\), so \\( n \\) must be at least 17.\n2. For \\( 7 \\) to be a factor, \\( n \\) must be at least 7, which is already satisfied since \\( n \\) must be at least 17.\n3. For \\( 3^3 \\), we check the number of 3s in \\( 17! \\):\n   \\[\n   \\left\\lfloor \\frac{17}{3} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{17}{9} \\right\\rfloor = 5 + 1 = 6\n   \\]\n   This is more than the required 3.\n4. For \\( 5^2 \\), we check the number of 5s in \\( 17! \\):\n   \\[\n   \\left\\lfloor \\frac{17}{5} \\right\\rfloor = 3\n   \\]\n   This is more than the required 2.\n\nSince \\( 17! \\) contains all the necessary prime factors with sufficient exponents, the least positive integer \\( n \\) such that \\( 80325 \\) divides \\( n! \\) is 17.\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{17}\n\\]"
