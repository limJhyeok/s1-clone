    "question": "Coin $A$ is flipped three times and coin $B$ is flipped four times. What is the probability that the number of heads obtained from flipping the two fair coins is the same?",
    "solution": "The result will occur when both $A$ and $B$ have either $0,$ $1,$ $2,$ or $3$ heads, and these probabilities are shown in the table. \\[ \begin{array}{ccccc} \text{Heads} & 0 & 1 & 2 & 3 \\ \\hline {} & & & & \\[-9pt] A & \\dfrac{1}{8} & \\dfrac{3}{8} & \\dfrac{3}{8} & \\dfrac{1}{8} \\[8pt] \\hline {} & & & & \\[-9pt] B & \\dfrac{1}{16}& \\dfrac{4}{16}& \\dfrac{6}{16}& \\dfrac{4}{16} \\end{array} \\] The probability of both coins having the same number of heads is \\[ \frac{1}{8}\\cdot \frac{1}{16} + \frac{3}{8}\\cdot \frac{4}{16} + \frac{3}{8}\\cdot \frac{6}{16} + \frac{1}{8}\\cdot \frac{4}{16} = \boxed{\frac{35}{128}}. \\]",
    "attempt": "To find the probability that the number of heads obtained from flipping coin A three times and coin B four times is the same, we denote the number of heads from coin A as \\(X\\) and the number of heads from coin B as \\(Y\\). We need to calculate \\(P(X = Y)\\).\n\nFirst, we compute the probabilities for each possible number of heads for both coins using the binomial distribution formula:\n\nFor coin A (flipped three times):\n- \\(P(X = 0) = 0.125\\)\n- \\(P(X = 1) = 0.375\\)\n- \\(P(X = 2) = 0.375\\)\n- \\(P(X = 3) = 0.125\\)\n\nFor coin B (flipped four times):\n- \\(P(Y = 0) = 0.0625\\)\n- \\(P(Y = 1) = 0.25\\)\n- \\(P(Y = 2) = 0.375\\)\n- \\(P(Y = 3) = 0.25\\)\n- \\(P(Y = 4) = 0.0625\\)\n\nNext, we compute the joint probabilities for each possible equal number of heads and sum them up:\n\n- \\(P(X = 0, Y = 0) = 0.125 \\times 0.0625 = 0.0078125\\)\n- \\(P(X = 1, Y = 1) = 0.375 \\times 0.25 = 0.09375\\)\n- \\(P(X = 2, Y = 2) = 0.375 \\times 0.375 = 0.140625\\)\n- \\(P(X = 3, Y = 3) = 0.125 \\times 0.25 = 0.03125\\)\n\nSumming these probabilities:\n\n\\[\n0.0078125 + 0.09375 + 0.140625 + 0.03125 = 0.2734375\n\\]\n\nThis result can be expressed as a fraction, which simplifies to \\(\\frac{35}{128}\\).\n\nThus, the probability that the number of heads obtained from flipping the two fair coins is the same is \\(\\boxed{\\dfrac{35}{128}}\\)."
