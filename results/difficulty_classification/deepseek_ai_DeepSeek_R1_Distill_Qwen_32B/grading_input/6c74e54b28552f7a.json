    "question": "A triangle has vertices $A(-4, -1)$, $B (2, -1)$ and $C(1, 3)$. What is the area, in square units, of triangle $ABC$?",
    "solution": "Let side $AB$ be the base; it has length $2+4=6$ since it is horizontal. The altitude from $C$ to $AB$ is the length of the vertical distance from the line to $C$, which is $1+3=4$. Thus the area is $$\frac{6(4)}{2}=\boxed{12}$$",
    "attempt": "To find the area of triangle \\(ABC\\) with vertices \\(A(-4, -1)\\), \\(B(2, -1)\\), and \\(C(1, 3)\\), we can use the shoelace formula and the base-height method.\n\nFirst, using the shoelace formula:\n\\[\n\\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left| x_1(y_2 - y_3) + x_2(y_3 - y_1) + x_3(y_1 - y_2) \\right|\n\\]\nSubstituting the coordinates:\n\\[\n\\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left| (-4)(-1 - 3) + 2(3 - (-1)) + 1(-1 - (-1)) \\right|\n\\]\nCalculating each term:\n\\[\n-4(-4) = 16, \\quad 2(4) = 8, \\quad 1(0) = 0\n\\]\nSumming these:\n\\[\n16 + 8 + 0 = 24\n\\]\nTaking the absolute value and dividing by 2:\n\\[\n\\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 24 = 12\n\\]\n\nNext, using the base-height method:\n- The base \\(AB\\) is horizontal, so its length is:\n  \\[\n  |2 - (-4)| = 6\n  \\]\n- The height is the vertical distance from \\(C\\) to the line \\(AB\\):\n  \\[\n  |3 - (-1)| = 4\n  \\]\n- Applying the area formula:\n  \\[\n  \\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 6 \\times 4 = 12\n  \\]\n\nBoth methods give the same result. Therefore, the area of triangle \\(ABC\\) is \\(\\boxed{12}\\) square units."
