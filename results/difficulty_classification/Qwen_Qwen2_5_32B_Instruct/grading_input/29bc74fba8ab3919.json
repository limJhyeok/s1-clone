    "question": "An elephant and a lion are currently 1 mile apart. The elephant runs directly away from the lion at 19 miles per hour, while the lion runs directly towards the elephant at 24 miles per hour.  How many minutes will it take for the lion to catch the elephant?",
    "solution": "Every hour, the lion runs 24 miles while the elephant runs 19.  Thus, the distance between the two animals closes at a rate of 5 miles every hour.  The lion catches the elephant after this distance has closed 1 mile, which takes $\\frac{1}{5}$ hours to do, or $\\frac{1}{5}\\cdot 60 = \\boxed{12}$ minutes.",
    "attempt": "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time it will take for the lion to catch the elephant given their speeds and the initial distance between them.\n\nThe initial distance between the elephant and the lion is 1 mile. The elephant is running away at 19 miles per hour, and the lion is running towards the elephant at 24 miles per hour. Therefore, the relative speed at which the distance between them is decreasing is the sum of their speeds:\n\n\\[ 24 \\text{ miles per hour} + 19 \\text{ miles per hour} = 43 \\text{ miles per hour} \\]\n\nThis means that the distance between the elephant and the lion is decreasing at a rate of 43 miles per hour. To find the time it takes for the lion to catch the elephant, we divide the initial distance by the relative speed:\n\n\\[ \\text{Time} = \\frac{\\text{Distance}}{\\text{Relative Speed}} = \\frac{1 \\text{ mile}}{43 \\text{ miles per hour}} \\]\n\nThis gives us the time in hours. To convert this time into minutes, we multiply by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):\n\n\\[ \\text{Time in minutes} = \\frac{1}{43} \\times 60 \\approx 1.3953 \\text{ minutes} \\]\n\nRounding to the nearest minute, the time it takes for the lion to catch the elephant is approximately:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{1.4} \\]\n\nHowever, if we are to provide the exact answer without rounding, it is:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\frac{60}{43}} \\]\n\nThis is the exact time in minutes for the lion to catch the elephant."
